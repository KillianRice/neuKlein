README FOR CAMERALINK FRAME GRABBER DRIVER INSTALLATION:  

Caution! PLEASE EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING STEPS WHILE INSTALLING CAMERALINK
FRAME GRABBERS:

- Switch off your computer and install the CameraLink frame grabber
  board.
- Connect the camera with the board while the camera is switched off.
- Start the computer.
- If the system pops up (the) hardware driver wizard(s) select 'Cancel'!!!
- Install the appropriate runtime package.
- Restart the computer and follow the steps to install the driver(s).
- Restart again.
- Install CamWare and / or the pco.camera.sdk.
- Power on the camera.

ATTENTION! Please install the appropriate runtime on your system!
On a 32bit System (Vista, W7, W8) use the 32bit runtime installation.
On a 64bit System (Vista, W7, w8) use the 64bit runtime installation.

In case you've got a 64bit system and your applications are still 32bit
you can install the 32bit runtime only, or both.

In case of a Matrox frame grabber please take care that sufficient 'non-paged'
memory is supplied. 32MB is enough for pco.1200, pco.1600. For the pco.2000
and pco.4000 setup 64MB. This value can be adjusted during the setup of the
MIL software package or afterwards with the Milconfig.exe.
See 'Start-Program Files-Matrox Imaging-Tools-MilConfig'.
